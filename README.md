### An NFT marketplace acts as the central hub where users can browse and purchase NFT-based memberships for various events. These memberships can provide access to exclusive content, events, or services. The NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) serve as digital proofs of membership and can be easily verified and transferred on the blockchain.

### The NFT marketplace allows users to buy membership NFTs using either cryptocurrency or fiat currency. Additionally, users can choose the teams they want to support, and the funds from the purchase will be directed to those selected teams. This adds an element of fan engagement and direct support for teams through the marketplace.

### Membership holders, represented by their NFT memberships, gain access to various activities and events organized by sports clubs or teams. The type of membership NFT they hold determines the level of access and the specific events they can participate in. This system ensures that membership benefits are tailored to different tiers and offers exclusive experiences to members.

### Registered organizations on the platform have the ability to create events and mint NFT memberships tailored to these events. These NFT memberships serve as digital tickets or passes that grant holders access to the events and possibly other exclusive benefits. This system allows organizations to manage their events efficiently and securely, while also offering a unique and engaging experience for their members.
