# World Cup NFTs 

## Project Overview
Develop an NFT platform dedicated to the World Cup 2026 using Ethereum as the blockchain platform. The platform will offer digital collectibles representing memorable moments, players, and teams from the tournament. Users will be able to buy and sell NFTs with using our platform.
One of the important features is that part of the purchasing prices can go to the teams that the buyer want to donate to, in which fans can support the teams 
they want and the team can use the fund for continuous development.
