# World Cup NFTs 

## Project Overview
The project Sport Key aims to develop a specialized NFT platform tailored for colleges and universities, providing a unique digital membership experience. This platform will not only offer digital memberships but also feature NFTs representing memorable moments, standout players, and iconic teams from collegiate tournaments. Users will have the ability to buy, sell, and trade these NFTs, creating a dynamic and engaging marketplace.
